## Overview

### The challenge
The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have learned many things from this assignment like using github for example and using different style engines, I could enhance my designing skills and problem-solving skills.If you want to be a great developer, you have to be curious and learn new things every day.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("🎉");
};
```

### Useful resources

- ([Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)) - This helped me for styling reason. I used to use bootstrap before but I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-front-end-web-development-projects-for-beginners/)- This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand few important aspects of a good front-end develpment project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
