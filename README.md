## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have learned many things from this assignment like using github for example and using different style engines, I could enhance my designing skills and problem-solving skills.If you want to be a great developer, you have to be curious and learn new things every day.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

## Acknowledgments
I am thankful for First Launch for giving me an oppertunity to code this beautiful website. I have got a lot of practice doing this and will keep improving my skills in future.
